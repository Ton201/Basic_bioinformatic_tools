In this repo, you will find code files that solve commod tasks when working with DNA and protein sequences.

-    reformat\_DNA/reformat_AA: Outputs a universal header ">output" first. The sys library is used to read the input line by line. Each line is then filtered so that only letters are sent to the output.

-    reverse\_complement_DNA: Lines are again read from the input using the sys library. A reverse function is written to reverse the lines and ensure output in the 5' -> 3' direction. The letters in each line are then translated in a loop mapped to a translation dictionary.

-    statistic\_DNA: This file loads the entire input file. It then calculates the frequency of each letter, the sequence length, and its MD5 hash.

-    get\_region: This file extracts a segment from the sequence according to provided arguments. Unlike Python indexing, it starts from 1 and includes both boundaries.

-    translate: This file reads the sequence and prepares three sets of triplets. This is necessary because we donâ€™t know the starting position of the translation. These sets are then translated according to the genetic code.
